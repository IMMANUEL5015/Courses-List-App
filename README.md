# Courses List App

## Overview
This web app allows users to store a list of the courses they are currently taking in school.

The app stores three categories of course details:
* The name of the course (e.g. **Linear Algebra**).
* A description of the course (e.g **This course deals with the branch of mathematics that concerns linear equations and their representations through matrices and vector spaces.**).
* A course code (e.g. **Math 101** ).
## Purpose
I built this simple project, merely to practise and demonstrate my knowledge of basic JavaScript.

## Technologies Used
HTML (Structure and Content of the Webpage)

CSS (Custom Styling of the Web page)

BOOTSTRAP (Basic Styling Components)

JAVASCRIPT (Interactivity and Logic)

GIT (Version Control and interacting with GitHub)

GITHUB (Open source my code for collaboration and criticism)

COMMAND LINE (Manipulate files and folders).

## Notice
This app will not store your course details forever. Once the browser window is refreshed, your details will be lost.

For best experience, use either chrome or firefox browser.
